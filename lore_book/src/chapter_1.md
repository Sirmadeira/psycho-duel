# Chapter 1 - The Will of the Project 
<!-- SIDENOTE THESE CHAPTERS ARE PIECES OF LORE -->

- Welcome to **Psycho Duel**, the arena awaits you here, you will go beyond, achieve greatness, and KNOW A WORLD *pauses*  
I am so tired of this... this false... hope?

- What is your name again?  
- **UNKNOWN**, well it seems you are just like me  **UNKNOWN**.  

Well?! Let’s see, ah yes... You have one sole task **UNKNOWN**, JUST climb the **Tower**. hehe................

-**How**  
how how how how how how how how how how how how HOW?

**Money**
Is everything.  
We need it to survive; those without it are worthless. It is about time you learned **THAT** lesson.

---
**Power** 
I wonder how you would get it...  
Of course, you could kill those who **accept it**, but alone? No, not alone, impossible...

---
**Unity**  
Alone, yes. I once was alone. We were... Not anymore it seens

Unity is the way to ascension. Alone, a human can’t challenge the eternal climb.  
A human will...

**fall.**

---
**Creativity**  
The Tower is a relentless mistress, but she does contain our **hope**, even **unwilling**.  
Perhaps inside it, we can find... **CLIMB**

---
**Determination**
No, not here. Determination is nothing. The climb is unstoppable. We will never reach the end. We are **hopeless**. ONLY...

---
**Discipline**  
Discipline will help us. Through her, we climb. Through her, we find reason. Are we **drones**? Can’t we think?  
**NO**, we can. **WE MUST THINK.** Thinkers see through...

---
**Gods**  
LIE. THEY ARE ALL LIES.  
The **Tower** is the only truth. Perhaps climbing it, we can try...  
But it is so hard. So hard...

---
**Hardship**  
The climb gets harder once you are reaching the top, if there is one...  
Well, that is it. That is how you climb it.

I hope I helped you. I am not sorry if I couldn’t. After all, you are one **OF THEM**?

#### DONT OBEY HIM 
If you want to **survive**.
