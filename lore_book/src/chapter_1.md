# Chapter 1 - The Will of the Project  

**Figure:** Welcome to **Psycho Project**. The arena awaits you. Here, you will go beyond, achieve greatness, and KNOW A WORLD...  
*pauses*  
I am so tired of this... this false... hope?

**Figure:** What is your name again?  

**Player:** **UNKNOWN.**

**Figure:** Well, it seems you are just like me, **UNKNOWN**.  
Well?! Let’s see, ah yes... You have one sole task, **UNKNOWN**. JUST climb the **Tower**. hehe...

**[silence]**

**Player:** **How?**

**[The air grows heavy.]**

**Figure:** I am JUST so tired, you know...

**[The air grows even heavier.]**

**Figure:** OKAY! Okay... **[angrily]**

**Figure:** Money...
Is everything. We need it to survive; those without it are worthless. It is about time you learned THAT lesson.  

**Figure:** Power...  
I wonder how you would get it... Of course, you could kill those who **accept it**, but alone? No, not alone, impossible...

**Figure:** Unity... 
Alone, yes. I once was alone. We were... Not anymore, it seems. Unity is the way to ascension. Alone, a human can’t challenge the eternal climb. A human will...

**[extra tone here]** **fall.**

**Figure:** Creativity...  
The Tower is a relentless mistress, but she does contain our **hope**, even **unwilling**. Perhaps inside it, we can find... **CLIMB**

**Figure:** Determination...  
No, not here. Determination is nothing. The climb is unstoppable. We will never reach the end. We are **hopeless**. ONLY...

**Figure:** Discipline...  
Discipline will help us. Through her, we climb. Through her, we find reason. Are we **drones**? Can’t we think?  
NO, we can. **WE MUST THINK.** Thinkers see through...

**Figure:** Gods...  
LIE. THEY ARE ALL LIES. The **Tower** is the only truth. Perhaps climbing it, we can try... But it is so hard. So hard...

**Figure:** Hardship...  
The climb gets harder once you are reaching the top—if there is one... Well, that is it. That is how you climb it.

**Figure:** I hope I helped you. I am not sorry if I couldn’t; no point in trying harder... no point...  
*pauses*

**[The figure suddenly changes tone, urgency in their voice.]**

**Figure:** RENEMBER DON’T OBEY HIM.If you want to **survive**— 

**Player:** **Who?**   Who Who Who Who Who Who Who Who?

**Figure:** YOU KNOW WHO, GODDAMMIT!  

**Player:** **The... the... the...**  announ?

**Figure:** Yes... and as if on queue, here he goes again...
