# Psycho Duel

Welcome to **Psycho Duel**, the arena awaits. Go beyond, be beyond, go greatness...  
I am so tired of this... What is your name again? **UNKNOWN**, well it seems you are just like me.  

You have only one sole task: climb the **Tower**. How?

## Money
- **Is everything.** We need it to survive; those without it are worthless. It is about time you learned your lesson.

## Power
- *I wonder how you would get it...* Of course, you could kill those who **accept it**, but alone? Hah, impossible...

## Unity
- **Alone, yes. I once was alone.** Unity is the way to ascension. Alone, a human can’t challenge the eternal climb.  
A human will...  

**fall.**

## Creativity
- **The Tower** is a relentless mistress, but she does contain our **hope**, even **unwilling**.  
Perhaps inside it, we can find...  

**happy.**

## Determination
- No, not here. Determination is nothing. The climb is unstoppable. We will never reach the end. We are **hope**less. ONLY...

## Discipline
- **Discipline** will help us. Through her, we climb. Through her, we find reason. Are we **drones**? Can’t we think?  
No, we can. **WE MUST THINK.** Thinkers see through.

## Gods
- **LIE. THEY ARE ALL LIES.** The **Tower** is the only truth. Perhaps climbing it, we can try...  
But it is so hard. So hard...

## Hardship
- The climb gets harder once you are reaching the top, if there is one...  
Well, that is it. That is how you climb it.  

I hope I helped you. I am not sorry if I couldn’t. After all, you are a—wait, what are we?

# Climbers. Lifers. Fighters. 

You must fight me
if you want to **survive.**
